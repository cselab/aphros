The CPC non-profit use licence agreement is an agreement between the 
author(s) of a program distributed by the CPC Program Library and the person 
who acquires it. By acquiring the program the person is agreeing to be bound 
by the terms of this agreement.

1.  This licence entitles the licensee (one person) and the licensee's research 
    group to obtain a copy of the source or executable code and to use the 
    acquired program for academic or non-profit use within a research 
    group; or, it entitles the licensee (one company, organisation or 
    computing centre) to install the program and allow access to the 
    executable code to members of the licensee's organisation for academic 
    or non-profit use. No user or site will re-distribute the source code or 
    executable code to a third party in original or modified form without the 
    written permission of the author.

2.  Publications which result from using the acquired program will reference 
    the article in Computer Physics Communications which describes the 
    program.
    
3.  This licence does not permit any commercial (profit-making or 
    proprietary) use or re-licensing or re-distributions. Persons interested in 
    for-profit use should contact the author.
    
4.  To the extent permissible under applicable laws, no responsibility is 
    assumed and is hereby disclaimed by Elsevier for any injury and/or 
    damage to persons or property as a result of any actual or alleged 
    libelous statements, infringement of intellectual property or privacy 
    rights, or products liability, whether resulting from negligence or 
    otherwise, including without limitation from any use or operation of any 
    ideas, instructions, procedures, products or methods contained in the 
    material therein. Access to this site is provided on an "as is" basis, and 
    Elsevier does not warrant that the information or software contained 
    herein is complete or accurate or free from error.
    This information or software is provided by its creators or authors as a
