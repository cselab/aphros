# Deploy

Requires having `$HOME/bin` in `PATH`.
Prepare the environment and install dependencies:

*   install all packages except for hypre 

     ```
     P=prefix ./all
     ```

    to `prefix` and files `ch.prefix` and `ch.setenv` to `$HOME/bin` 
*   set environment 

     ```
     . ~/bin/ch.setenv
     ```

*   install hypre 

     ```
     cd hypre 
     ./_run
     ```

# Other

## Prefix

* Read from `$P` if set
* Else from ch.prefix if found in `PATH`
* Else defaults to `prefix`

## Run all packages

    ./all

## Run a single package (e.g. hypre)

    cd hypre
    ./_run 

## Setenv

* `ch.setenv` is written to `$B` (`B=$HOME/bin` in `util`)
  along with `ch.prefix`
* All other units are installed to `$BB` (`BB=$P/bin` in `util`)
* `ch.setenv` adds `$BB` to `PATH` and makes installed units available.
  This prevents the user from running units in an incomplete environment
  (e.g. modules loaded).

## Rules

* Each folder is a package.
* Packages consist of units.
* Unit is an executable or shell script.
* Unit can be executed. Shell scripts can also be sourced.
* _Machine suffix_ is a unique name associated to a particular machine.
* _System unit_ is a unit located in `PATH`.
* Name of a system unit has prefix `.ch` (_standard prefix_).
* System units can be executed or sourced from any folder.
* Unit can call other units by their name. Lookup order:
  - its folder with machine suffix,
  - its folder,
  - `common` with machine suffix,
  - `common`,
  - `PATH` with standard prefix.
* File `util` defines functions available to all units
  - `run()`: lookup and execute,
  - `src()`: lookup and source.
* User can call or source:
  - unit `_run` from containing folder,
  - system units.
* Unit `_run` should source `util`.
* Restrictions apply to system units:
  - can execute or source only system units,
  - need to source `ch.util` to make functions from `util` available.
* Reserved variables:
  - `P`: install path prefix
  - `B`: default `$HOME/bin`
  - `MS`: machine suffix
  - `PRE`: standard prefix
  
TODO some places assume `PRE=ch`
