# Surface tension as gradient

Goal: 
  zero integral of force

What: 
  surface tension as $$\nabla (\kappa \alpha)$$ on faces,
  curvature in cells copied from neighbour faces if nan.

Result: 
  instability for test of single drop equilibrium, 

Data:
    log01_grad_ka:

    grad_ka.mp4: surface tension as $$\nabla (\kappa * \alpha)$$
    k_grad_a.mp4: surface tension as $$\kappa \nabla \alpha$$
    k_grad_a_kmean.mp4: mean curvature on face if both cells contain interface
