.. hdf5 read/write scalar field in hdf5

HDF5 IO wrapper
===============

Synopsis
--------

A library to read/write scalar field on uniform grid.

::

   #include <h5.h>

.. includecode:: deploy/lib/h5/h5.h

::

   #include <h5serial.h>

.. includecode:: deploy/lib/h5/h5serial.h

Description
-----------

A field is stored as two files: hdf5 file contains data and xmf file
contains information.

h5_serial_hdf write scalar field of dimension size[3] to file path.h5.

h5_hdf write path.h5 using MPI.

h5_xmf writes xmf file.

h5_read_hdf reads scalar field from path.h5.

h5_read_xmf reads information about a field from path.xmf.
