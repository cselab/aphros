Output
======

Simulations produce output of various types:

* statistics (stdout)
* fields (HDF5, plain or XML VTK)
* PLIC polygons (polydata legacy VTK)
* marching cubes triangles (polydata legacy VTK)
* boundary conditions (polydata legacy VTK)

Boundary conditions are written to ``bc.vtk`` if enabled by ``set int dumpbc 1``.
It contains cell fields
``block`` (block id), ``cond`` (conditions for advection)
and ``condfluid`` (conditions for fluid, see :ref:`t:fluidcond`).

The output is implemented in function

.. includecode:: src/util/hydro.ipp
  :func: DumpBcFaces
