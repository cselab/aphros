Small bubbles produced in salty water by breaking waves
do not behave in the usual way.
Instead of coalescing with the surface,
they rise without bursting and join together.
The clusters of bubbles appear as white foam.
We show how foam is created by breaking waves
using a novel numerical algorithm
that can describe the motion of bubbles without coalescence.
Apart from producing photorealistic images of water with foam,
this can improve the accuracy of weather and climate models.
