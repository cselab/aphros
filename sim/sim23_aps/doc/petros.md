Hi Petros,

Is this plan ok for the APS movie?

Motivation: coalescence is a topic of active research
and important for applications.

We show two limit cases (coalescence fully prevented or fully allowed).

Plan:

1. Introduction (40sec)
Coalescence of two bubbles (view like in paper of Lohse)
and drop impact on a surface (interface of water and oil).
Introduce surface tension and mechanisms for coalescence prevention:
surfactants, viscous film drainage, Marangoni flow.

2. Bubbles floating on free surface (30sec):
A column of rising bubbles.

3. Plunging jet (60sec)
Formation of larger bubbles or bouncing and floating bubbles.

4. Breaking waves (50sec) 
Salt water vs fresh water, formation of foam, connection to nature.


Sequence of videos:

1a: coalescence of two bubbles
1b: drop resting on free surface

2a: bubbles reach the surface and disappear
2b: bubbles gather into foam

3a: plunging jet with coalescence
3b: plunging jet without coalescence

4a: breaking wave with coalescence
4b: breaking wave without coalescence
