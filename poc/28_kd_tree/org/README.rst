Overview
--------
kdtree is a simple, easy to use C library for working with kd-trees.

Kd-trees are an extension of binary search trees to k-dimensional data. They
facilitate very fast searching, and nearest-neighbor queries.

This particular implementation is designed to be efficient and very easy to
use. It is completely written in ANSI/ISO C, and thus completely
cross-platform.

See under the ``doc/`` and ``examples/`` directories to find out how to use the
kdtree library.
