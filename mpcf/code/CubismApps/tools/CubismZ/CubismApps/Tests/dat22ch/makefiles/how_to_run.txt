1. Generate binary file from h5

h5dump -b LE -o data-301-g.bin data-301-g.h5 

2. Generate reference binary file 

./genref2.sh  (initial binary file -> ch (no compression) -> ordered binary file )


3. Build and evaluate compression method

 ./runme2.sh  (initial binary file -> ch (compressed) -> ordered binary file )


4. Test previously built compression method

./runme2var.sh 0.01  (avoid recompiling, takes threshold as argument)
