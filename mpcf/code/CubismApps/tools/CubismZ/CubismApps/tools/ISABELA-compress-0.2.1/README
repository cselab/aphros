=== ABOUT ===

ISABELA is a compression routine designed for floating-point datasets. ISABELA's
algorithm proceeds by first dividing a floating-point array into windows of
fixed sizes. Values in each window are sorted, and the sorted representation is
approximated using BSplines or Wavelets. The intuition behind this technique is
that while sorting poses an overhead, the data becomes smooth enough to be
approximated accurately with fewer coefficients.

=== COMPRESSION OPTIONS ===

ISABELA has the following parameters that affect storage size and accuracy:

    * W0 - Window size:
        Typical values for W0 are 512, 1024, 2048. 
        The total size taken up by the index per window is W0 * log2(W0) bits.

    * C - Number of co-efficients (per window):
        Typically values for C are 20 - 50.
        Each co-efficient is stored as the same datatype (float or double) as
        the input data.

    * epsilon - Error-rate (relative error (%) bounded per point)
        To bound the relative error per-point, the deltas between original and
        approximate are captured and compressed. To disable this error encoding
        set the error rate to 0.
        The total size for storing compressed errors varies with the dataset. 

    * BSplines / Wavelets
        BSplines were originally created to support per-point decompression.
        Wavelets offer faster compression, decompression rates, and slightly
        higher accuracy.

All these parameters can be set using isabela_config. In the paper, unless
otherwise specified W0 = 1024 elements, and C = 30. These parameter values have
been derived from emperical evaluations and can vary from dataset to dataset.  

=== RESTRICTIONS ===

Currently, 32-bit single-precision and 64-bit double-precision floating-point
datasets are supported. The code has been tested only on little-endian
architectures and Red Hat Linux.

Using very high min/max values to represent 'nodata' can affect the
approximation accuracy.
